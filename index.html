      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm an applied physics student currently studying at Northeastern University, ultimately looking to work in the energy industry with an eye to nuclear fusion as a 
         particularly interesting and important problem. I began my undergraduate studies undeclared in the college of engineering, where I acquired many 
         practical engineering design skills including Solidworks, AutoCAD, Matlab, C++ and Arduino. During this time, I also decided I had an interest in 
         pursuing physics in greater detail, leading to me to declare in Applied Physics as a compromise. Since then, I have taken a variety of physics classes 
         (Modern Physics, Classical Dynamics, E&M 1&2), while continuing to apply what I learn in assorted academic projects. I have also discovered passions 
         for scientific computing and medical imaging/CT.</p>
      <h1>About This Website</h1>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my website! I made this website primarily as a portfolio to showcase some of professional projects I've worked on, 
         as well as a place to keep some documentation on some personal and class related projects. These projects include modeling particle trajectories in non-uniform
         magnetic fields, designing a three-bit adder, building a robotic obstacle course, implementing a simple particle in cell model, using finite difference 
         methods to calculate a magnetic field from a distrubtion of particle velocities, writing simple analytic CT simulation, and writing samples from an 
         advanced lab course. I'm also using this as an oppertunity to teach myself html </p>
