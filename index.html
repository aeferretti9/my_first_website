      <h1>About This Website</h1>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my website! I made this website primarily as a portfolio to showcase some of professional projects I've worked on, 
         as well as a place to keep some documentation on some personal and class related projects. These include modeling particle trajectories in non-uniform
         magnetic fields, designing a three-bit adder, building a robotic obstacle course, implementing a simple particle in cell model, using finite difference 
         methods to calculate a magnetic field from a distrubtion of particle velocities, writing simple analytic CT simulation, and writing samples from an 
         advanced lab course. I'm also using this as an oppertunity to teach myself html </p>
